# Image-Completion
In this project, we will remove a part of an image and try to reconstruct it. The images are resized to 256x256 and grayscaled to have 1 channel. The outpout size will also be the 256x256x1 but only the removed part will be considered as an output and for calculating the loss. The model used is a simple Autoencoder.
